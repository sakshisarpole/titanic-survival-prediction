# Titanic Survival Prediction 

This project is a Machine Learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, gender, class, and other attributes. The implementation is done in Python using Jupyter Notebook.


## Features
- Data preprocessing using Pandas and NumPy  
- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical variables using LabelEncoder  
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Model training with:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree Classifier  
  - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)  
- Model evaluation using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report  
- Predicting survival for new input data
